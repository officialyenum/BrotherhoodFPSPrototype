# Drone Defiance

Earth is on the brink of destruction, and you're its last hope. In Drone Defiance, you must battle through hordes of alien-controlled drones in a race against time. Destroy all drones or locate the hidden core to shut them down for good. But that's not all – once the drones are down, the clock is still ticking. Find the key, get to the escape vehicle, and get out alive. You have just two minutes to complete your mission, or it's game over. Will you defy the drones and save humanity?
